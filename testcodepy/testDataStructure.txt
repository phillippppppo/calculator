The testdatastructure should look like this:

it ("", () => {
 
});

An example given:

test("renders without crashing", () => {
  const div = document.createElement("div");
  const root = createRoot(div);
  
  act(() => {
    root.render(<App />);
  });
});

/**
 * @jest-environment jsdom
 */

import React from "react";
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { act } from 'react-dom/test-utils';
import App from "./component/App";
import Button from "./component/Button";
import ButtonPanel from "./component/ButtonPanel";
import Display from "./component/Display";
import calculate from "./logic/calculate";
import isNumber from "./logic/isNumber";
import operate from "./logic/operate";
import chai from "chai";
import * as testingLibrary from '@testing-library/react';

The imports from the above are already in the file! Do not write the imports in your answer! Do not answer with anything but code or code comments!

Only give me ONE and I mean ONE test per request!

DO NOT WRITE ANYTHING LIKE: I apologize for the error. It seems that there was a mistake in my previous response. The test case code should not have been included in the answer. After a test failed. ONLY ANSWER IN CODE!
